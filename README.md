##**Overview of Project**
This research case study’s aim is to help Louise know the outcomes of the fundraising goal for certain type of projects within their launch dates. Louise does a wide variety of fundraising with Parent Categories ranging from Film & Video, technology, music to photography and Subcategories or genre under the Parent categories. 

###**Purpose**
The purpose of this research project is to analyze the outcomes of the fundraising goal for Theater (Parent category) and Plays (Subcategory) projects. With the analysis, graphs and deliverables the project will provide, Louise will have an understanding of how many projects’ fundraising goals were successful, failed or canceled with a given amount of time.  


##**Analysis and Challenges**
There weren’t many difficult challenges but working with big data one must be thorough to see what data are provided. In the Kickstarter excel file the launch dates and deadline were in Unix time format, so I had to change it to a regular Day/Month/Year format. So, a new column with Date Created Conversion and Date Ended Conversion were created so I can analyze when the projects were launched and ended. I did this by using the formula
“ =(((launched_at/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)” for Date Created Conversion column 
“ =(((deadline/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)”  for Date Ended Conversion column 
This formula helped changed Unix time format to a readable date. This mandatory change helped me getting the month data for Outcomes Based on Launch Date Deliverable. 
Another necessary step was to divide up the Parent Category and Subcategory into two columns so I can a cleaner data for my pivot tables.
